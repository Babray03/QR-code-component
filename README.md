I am starting my first project that I found on the internet, through the website Frontend Mentor.
I do not have a laptop, I will be programming everything from my tablet which has a keyboard, mouse and stylus.



My Process 

I will be using the "Acode" app from the Google Play Store which works pretty well. 
From previous experience I found that linking images into my html from my androids file explorer is pretty tough if not impossible. 

I did some research into why using a regular file path to an image folder doesn't work,
and found one solution is to use an http server, so I will be using a simple HTTP server app I also found on the play store to help my images load.
I will change the file paths when I upload the code to github. The process is not to time consuming since I am not using too many images 
but it can be annoying when there are a lot of images. I also will be using internal style sheets for the same reason, 
that linking an external document or file is pretty much impossible for me on android. 

I accepted this extra proccess as the cost of using a android device instead of a PC. 

I will follow the recommendations found in the readme file they came with the project, so I will start coding with HTML and then style with CSS. 

I started off with a grid approach and separated each of the elements on the page into divs called sections which included the image, header and paragraph. 

This process was causing me to code to many divs so since it only contains a few elements I decided to go with a simple container and flex box approach.

I did end up leaving the image in a its own div section while the header and paragraph are wrapped in the container div with the image. 

I was having trouble getting everything to align, i discovered that using the flexbox approach really simplified everything after. Next difficult thing was getting the image to the right size without being distorted. I reviewed how to size images on w3schools and used a method to make the image fit to size and be responsize. 

After the image was to the size that I liked, from there it was just adding padding and margins and some styles to make everything look like the image provided for the web layout.

- What I learned
I enjoyed doing this challenge, as my first challenge creating something with using my own coding knowledge ( and lack there of) I was having fun figuring out how to make this look exactly like the finsihed project. 

I learned more about flex box especially with the flex direction and flex wrap, at first I used flex wrap to get the items to aligh with the container then I got rid of that and use flex direction which allowed me to ge the same type of alignment but with a better outcome since the content within the container seemed to align better. 

After getting the content to align better it was just adjusting the styles for the header and paragraph elements to make them look like the finished project especailly byÂ  adding line breaks and text align options. I was surprised to see how everything started to look like the finished product.
